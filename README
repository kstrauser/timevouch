TimeVouch.com is a public timestamping service. Users can "register" the
contents of files with the service, and then later use the service to prove
that the files existed at the time of registration and haven't been altered.

The timevouch project is a MIT-licensed interface to those services. It
consists of:

* timevouchclient.py, a client library which can be used to easily add
  timestamping features to other applications, and

* timevouchgui.py, a simple Qt GUI for registering and verifying files.

Both this project and the TimeVouch.com website are under active
development. However, the underlying service and its API are solid and
production-ready right now, even if the site's appearance is still in
flux. The service is considered "live" and fully ready for use, so please
feel free to get in at the beginning!
